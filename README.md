# Peek-a-Vue (v0.2.0-alpha)

The source code for the card-flipping Halloween themed game built with [Vue.js 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=peekavue-bh&utm_campaign=devex)!

If you're looking for the source code from the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQa9-4K3me4), check out the [2020-10-28 branch](https://github.com/bencodezen/peek-a-vue/tree/2020-10-28).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is an exploration to build a card flipping game using as much Composition API as possible. In other words, important things to remember are:

1. This repo should not be taken as a source of best practices since it is still a work in progress.
1. There will be lots of cases where it would make more sense to use the Options API instead, but for the sake of experimentation, I am intentionally ignoring the Options API as much as possible.
